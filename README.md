# CodeAlpha-Internship
This repository showcases a collection of hands-on cybersecurity projects developed during my second internship as a cybersecurity engineering student. Each project dives into a key area of modern cyber defense:

- Firewall – Custom rule-based network filtering to control traffic and enhance security.

- Packet Sniffing – Real-time traffic analysis to understand data flow and detect anomalies.

- Phishing Awareness – Simulated phishing campaigns to raise awareness and educate users on social engineering tactics.

These projects were designed to deepen my practical knowledge in cybersecurity and reinforce core concepts through real-world implementation.
